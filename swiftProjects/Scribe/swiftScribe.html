                <p>For me, Scribe, is the app I’ve wanted to create for a long time coming but my knowledge in Swift has been basic and limited. I wanted to take this as a challenge and an opportunity in order to broaden my knowledge in Swift and programming in general.</p>
                <p>So, what is <a href="https://github.com/AZaps/Scribe-Swift" target="_blank">Scribe</a>? Scribe is a new way to create, manage, and share reminders in a rewarding manner. Each reminder or task you set for yourself is now a challenging quest that rewards you with experience after completion. Essentially, I want to make your everyday, a real to life, role playing game. Rewarding yourself after completing tasks will not only entice you to create more but also make you more productive throughout the day. Completion of that small task, can brighten the rest of your day.</p>
                <p>I am still determining a way to award XP and possibly a character system involved where it can level up as you do. I also have ideas for small mini-games after completing a reminder to award bonus XP or items to outfit your character.</p>
                <p>I would also like to implement this within a school setting with the teacher being the task master. It seems a lot of students are being supplied with or own iDevices already and by taking advantage of that with my app, it would encourage students to complete tasks on a consistent basis. Instead of assigning homework, the teacher could assign tasks to all the students. They will be notified of a new task and upon completion, they can see their character grow with them. The teacher can set custom rewards depending on the task and also be notified once the given task has been completed. By monitoring the completion status of their students, extra activities could be planned depending on how many students completed the task in a timely manner.</p>
                <p style="text-align:center; padding-top:20px;">When ones’ life is full of activities, tasks, and objectives it can feel uplifting when given a small reward for completing those tasks. Creating that feeling is what I hope to achieve with Scribe.  </p>
